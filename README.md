This git repository accompanies the 8th  Summer School on Computational Interaction, ACM Europe School will be held at the University of Luxembourg, Belval campus, Luxembourg.  It will take place on June 03 - 07, 2024.

This summer school teaches HCI students, researchers, and industry professionals computational methods and their application in user interface design, interactive systems, user modeling, and more. Each day will feature one or two outstanding speakers who will share their expertise on a technical topic relevant to Computational Interaction. Individual lectures will give students an overview of different topics in Computational Interaction, and will include exercises that will give students hands-on experience with Computational Interaction research.
